// Why React was Created:

// Fantum Probleam

// Real-Time Update Challenge:
// Facebook needed a faster way to update message counts and notifications in real-time, especially for chat interactions.

// Single-Page Application (SPA) Solution:
// React was created to build a single-page application (SPA), allowing updates without refreshing the entire page, making the user experience smoother.

// Efficient State Management:
// React efficiently manages dynamic content, keeping track of changes without requiring the user to reload the page.

// Seamless User Experience:
// With React, Facebook achieved seamless updates, providing a smarter way to handle information without disrupting the user with page refreshes.


// 1. What is React?----------------------------------------------------------------------
// React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces
// specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

// Server-Side Rendering:
// React can help show parts of a webpage even before the whole page is fully loaded.

// Virtual DOM Usage:
// Instead of directly changing the webpage, React uses a smart system (Virtual DOM) to figure out what needs to be updated. This makes things faster.

// Unidirectional Data Flow:
// React has a clear way of managing information. Data flows in one direction, making it easier to understand and control.

// Reusable UI Components:
//  React lets developers build like using Lego blocks. You create pieces of the webpage (components) that you can use over and over again. It's like building with building blocks to make things quicker and consistent.


// 2. What are the advantages of using React?--------------------------------------------

// Efficiency with Virtual DOM:
// React uses a smart virtual version of the webpage, making things faster when the data changes. It's like having a quick planner to decide what updates are needed.

// Easy to Learn:
// Learning React is not hard. Even if you know a bit of JavaScript, you can start building web stuff with React. It's like an easy-to-use tool for beginners.

// SEO Friendly:
// Simple Explanation: React helps make websites that search engines like. It's like giving your website a map so search engines can find and show it easily.

// Reusable Components:
// React is like using building blocks. You create pieces (components) that can be used again and again. It's like having Lego bricks for building, making development faster.

// Many Choices in Libraries:
// React lets you pick the tools you like. It's like having a big toolbox with lots of options. You choose what's best for your project.

// 3.Limitations of React:---------------------------------------------------------------

// Not a Full Framework:
// React is like a handy tool, but it's not the whole toolbox. It's a library that does a lot, but you might need more tools for some jobs.

// Lots of Components:
// React has many parts (components), and it might take time to understand all the benefits. It's like having lots of Lego pieces—you need to learn how each one fits.

// hallenging for Beginners:+
// If you're just starting, React might feel tricky. It's like learning a new game—it takes a bit to get the hang of it.

// Complex Coding with JSX:
// React sometimes uses a special way of writing code (JSX), which can look complicated. It's like using a unique language for coding—it might seem a bit different.

//What is JSX? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the 
// DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).
//As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.

//Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well

//Without using JSX, we would have to create an element by the following process:

const text = React.createElement('p', {}, 'This is a text');
const containerr = React.createElement('div','{}',text );
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);

//Using JSX, the above code can be simplified:

const container = (
    <div>
      <p>This is a text</p>
    </div>
    );
    ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);

    //class based component vs functional component------------------------------------------------------------

    // Why We Need Hooks in React:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Functional Simplicity:
    // Hooks make functional components handle state and React features, simplifying their capabilities.
    
    // Simplify Code:
    //Hooks reduce the need for class components, simplifying and organizing component logic.
    
    // Easy Understanding:
    //  Hooks make component logic more understandable and straightforward.
    
    // Reuse Logic:
    // Hooks enable logic reuse, making components more modular and maintainable.
    
    // Lifecycle Management:
    //  Hooks replace class-based lifecycle methods, managing lifecycles in functional components.
    
    // Cleaner Code:
    // Using hooks improves code readability, resulting in cleaner and more concise code.
